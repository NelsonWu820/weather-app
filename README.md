Weather App

Location
For finding their location's weather I gave the user 2 options
1. Allow the web app to track their location thorugh google (Haven't tested it on other browers because of time limitations). But if user wants to look at a location they will go to later this will not work, as will if they have their location turned off on google.
2. Input their general area (As inputing their exact address would lead to a worse user experience, their general town/city is sufficent). A fall back if they can't ot don't want to give their current location through google.

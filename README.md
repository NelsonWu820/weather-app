# Weather App

# Description
Using React, we're crafting a dynamic user interface that allows users to input multiple tags. When a picture encompasses all the specified tags, it dynamically appears for the user. The picture links are conveniently stored in a JSON file, facilitating easy access and serving to the user.

# Location
To find their location's weather I gave the user the google maps location search field, allows them to input their general area or their exact address if they want to.

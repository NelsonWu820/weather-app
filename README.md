# Weather App

# Description
Using React, we're crafting a dynamic user interface that allows users to input multiple tags. When a picture encompasses all the specified tags, it dynamically appears for the user. The picture links are conveniently stored in a JSON file, facilitating easy access and serving to the user.

# Location
To find their location's weather I gave the user 2 options
1. Allow the web app to track their location through Google (Haven't tested it on other browsers because of time limitations). But if the user wants to look at a location they will go to later this will not work, as will if they have their location turned off on Google.
2. Input their general area (As inputting their exact address would lead to a worse user experience, their general town/city is sufficient). A fallback if they can't or don't want to give their current location through Google.
